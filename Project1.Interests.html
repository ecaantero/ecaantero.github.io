<p> Among my interests, swimming stands out prominently. I am an active member of the swim club at UW, and our recent winter training trip to Florida was amazing! We spend time at practices and also at the beach! Engaging in meets adds to the excitement, with nationals approaching next month. Additionally, I am deeply involved in the Google Developers Club at UW Madison, as well as the Women in Business Tech Club. Beyond these pursuits, I have a passion for travel. Having explored numerous states already, I aspire to venture to Alaska someday. My travels extend beyond the U.S. borders; I've had the privilege of visiting countries such as Spain, Iceland, Italy, Lithuania, and more. Looking ahead, I am eagerly anticipating my upcoming semester abroad in Copenhagen, where I hope to further enrich my global experiences. </p>
